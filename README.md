# Strategic Growth Analysis for a UK-Based E-Commerce Retailer

## 1.1 Introduction: Your Role as Data Science Consultants

For this capstone project, your group will operate as a team of data science consultants. You have been engaged by the executive board of "Unique Gifts Ltd.," a UK-based, non-store online retailer that has carved a niche in the market by selling unique, all-occasion giftware. The company has enjoyed several years of organic growth and has amassed a significant volume of transactional data. However, their strategic decision-making process has been largely intuitive rather than data-driven.

The leadership team recognizes that to sustain growth, optimize operations, and increase profitability in a competitive market, they must leverage their data as a strategic asset. Your team's primary mandate is to conduct a thorough analysis of their historical sales data, uncover actionable insights, and provide a clear, data-backed strategic roadmap for the future. You are expected to move beyond simple reporting and deliver high-value business intelligence that can directly inform marketing, inventory, and customer relationship management strategies.
